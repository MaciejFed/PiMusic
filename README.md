# PiMusic

RaspberryPi project that based on simple configuration will ping ip in local network to save sleep and wake time(based on 
assumtion that if no machine responds to ping that means it's a sleep time). Additionaly there's integration with Spotify API
so Raspberry can play goodnight and good morning playlist.
